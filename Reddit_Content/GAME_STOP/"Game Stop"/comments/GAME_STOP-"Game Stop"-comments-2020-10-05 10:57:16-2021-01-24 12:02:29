one_who_asks,t2_116mus1d,"u/DeepFuckingValue is from the future and the only thing he bets on is Game Stop. Seems kind of ridiculous, but what if there's a reason a future man would only gamble on Game Stop?

Maybe in the future we all get take out from the Game Stop restaurant. We buy all our clothes from Game Stop. The Game Stop Mall is a one stop shop for all the Game Stop purchases your family needs. Cars and Jewelry are only of good quality if they came from Game Stop.

Don't believe me? Look at the man's comment history. There are rarely any long comments. Sounds like someone trying not to fuck around with the time continuum, and keep the future on course. About a week ago he was asked if he would use his 1.2M$ in cash for GME shares, and he simply replied,

Maybe I will.

Over a year ago a guy pointed out that he was losing money on GME, and pointed out several reasons for it's poor performance. He simply replied,

January 2021.

This is the reply of a man who knows the future. He doesn't understand that there are other bets to make because this Game Stop meme stock will literally let them overtake every single market they enter starting from Jan 2021. And that appears to be the only important date he knows.

So as a future man he began to YOLO everything into GME before 2021 turned the corner. He didn't care about the spread sheets and cost analysis reports. He was just an autist retard from the future that knew Game Stop would one day own the world, and that it all began in Jan of 2021.

He's turned 10's of thousands of dollars into over 10 million dollars, and he still isn't pulling out. This man knows something, and we need to YOLO into GME now if we want to be millionairs after a year too.",2021-01-23 23:21:14,gkgp6ce,t3_l3j3t8,t3_l3j3t8,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l3j3t8/the_coronation_of_udeepfuckingvalue/gkgp6ce/,419,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52,,,1,comment

Kevinx232,t2_66r2r,"Shares drive price. The more you buy the more it goes up. If you have money, shares right now = üöÄüöÄüöÄ not options (unleZ you have a broker selling 80-90 options, which they won't lol) This stock can easily get over $100 as the big banks have to cover, thus buying SHARES (this is the most shorted stock on the market right now). This is an options sub, but shares are money with GME. Just keep putting money in during a probable dip Monday (no need to worry as shorts have to cover which means buying more shares thus raising value which is more tendies) üíéüëê prevail even after a potential 20% dip.. Just keep buying every day - small amounts work. Just buy, or buy at game stop, like actual merchandise (to help bottom line) I'm watching this like a hawk and will keep buying, in smaller amount each day for the next week.

duplicatesnowflake,t2_lptfj,"Show me one example of either of those things happening on this sub. No one is talking about tricking any unsuspecting person. The goal is to ""load the stock off"" on the shorts who get margin called. If they weren't expecting that, they can blame themselves alone.

There aren't lies being posted here. Maybe some overly optimistic wishful predictions. No one is saying that game stop is about to do something they aren't. Ryan Cohen's involvement is a bullish catalyst period. No lies about that. The stock was overshorted. The book value of the company was more than the stock price by a huge margin. If this sub counts as manipulation then every famous short seller and hedge fund in the country is guilty as well. Good luck combing through millions of idiotic comments and memes to prove some mastermind orchestrated conspiracy. It's all out in the open for God's sake!

mak0shark7,t2_14mld4,"But can you really legislate ""good idea"" or ""more credible justifications"" when it comes to what is in essence gambling? 
If someone went into a casino and dropped their entire 401k on double zero and the entire casino was cheering him on and threw money down with him, I would say that's not a good move, probably less than credible evidence. Any stock seems to be a crap shoot to me in the long run. The blue chips from my childhood are toast now, and everyone on wall street is insider trading. 
When game stop fails as a business (and it will) the price will go down, when the members of this thread pull out Gamestop is gonna feel the wrath. And the shorts are gonna win anyway. It's a win win for everyone.

And as far as public article, this sub is public knowldge.

rahhbit,t2_ixjfe,"Honestly, depends on how much and what kind of money you‚Äôre working with. 

For me...it‚Äôs all investment money so if I loose it I‚Äôm ‚Äúfine.‚Äù

I‚Äôve read and read on the short stock component and personally feel really confident in the mechanics of how that works. 

I, personally, do not feel like I am at risk of losing and that belief is two fold. In the immediate it‚Äôs because of the mechanics of how the short squeeze works that I‚Äôm really confident. There‚Äôs some good posts about it you can look up that will explain it much better than I can. Plenty of people over simplify it, and plenty don‚Äôt even bother trying to understand it. 

Secondly, I really do believe GME has been undervalued. Both before Ryan Cohen was added to the board, but especially since he and his two colleagues have joined. 

His letter to the board makes a really good case for their turn around. 

Once I see they plan to take action on his vision, I‚Äôll sell my aapl stock for gme.

Edit to clarify: I‚Äôm quite long into gme at this point, but my BIG nest egg investment money is sitting in aapl.

If you start with 100shares available and mr short borrows 50, common sense says that only 50 should be left to trade.. 

All I know is I bought a 30$ call the other day for 40$ and and sold it for 660$ about 2 hours later so I‚Äôm good for now. I can walk away a winnerüòÇ. I‚Äôm gonna watch for awhile because I I think in the future that video game makers are going to only sell directly to the consumers. There is no need to go to game stop unless I want to buy hardware and in that case Amazon is going to beat everyone because they have the biggest buying power and they bring the product to my house. Unless gamestop can branch out into new ways to make money (like the computer kiosk idea) they are gonna be in trouble.

If you are using TTM (trailing 12 months) EBITDA based on last years earnings as an analog you are omitting the key part of bull thesis.

The more appropriate metric given the change in biz environment (RE cycle refresh) would be Price to Sales which at the current value is ~.46 times.  So, if you pencil double or triple percent sales growth for over the next 12 months the company looked cheap.  That‚Äôs the key part, the bears had a correct view up until the console refresh cycle started.  Then you add the Cohen component plus additional govt stimulus.

Carl_Franklin_JR,t2_6l8ls4rv,"Picture this in the not too distant future:

 1/5th of the brick and mortar Gamestops closed and the rest are remodeled. Instead a tired Radio-Shack looking toy shop, they feel like a hip Google office with comfortable seating. They limit their in-store retail to consoles and pc builds while the rest of the space feels more like a music venue with a livestreamed COD tournament going on in the corner, the place packed and buzzing, teens shouting and cheering, gen x-ers buying PS5 for their kids, even a boomer in there just to get a decent PC and everybody having a GREAT time. 

The Reginator's face is in every meme on WSB (which is now even more full of millionaires). Reg is the face of Gamespot's  blazing marketing campaign targeting the entire age demographic bringing all gamers and casuals to see Gamestop as THE name in games. He is gonna kick ass, take names and sell games.

Meanwhile, all of the physical stores and hype just serves to drive traffic to the cutting edge new game stop app and website. Ryan Fucking Cohen makes the most incredible, easy to use interface that knows what you want to buy and gives it to you for your birthday. Customers feel so connected to Gamestop because they have spent hours having fun in their stores, growing up with the brand and talking to an actual, highly paid customer service rep when they have a question. 

So Citron, Gamestop is worth $20 right now? Ok sure.

redditguyinblack,t2_19y4dr7i,"1. Some people, especially older people, are not sure what games to buy as gifts. They need advice and game stop employees can give that advice. Those customers may not know what to search and how to distinguish between good and bad games. GameStop is a name brand when it comes to video games and many older people trust it for finding those gifts.

2. If GME begins having build your own PC stations, people will go to talk to a professional to get their opinion and especially for the experience of doing that with a kid. That‚Äôs a really nice moment for parents and kids to bond over and would be fun.

3. GameStop seems to be moving into a model more focused on a more wholistic focused gaming experience including items for games that aren‚Äôt sold at most other regular stores because they are too niche as well as providing an atmosphere for gamers to hang and play games if they end up going that route as well.",2021-01-20 15:27:22,gjya9tc,t3_l19k9r,t1_gjy9hfk,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l19k9r/gme_megathread_lemon_party_keep_your_shitposting/gjya9tc/,2,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52,,,0,comment

HotDamImHere,t2_56b048mn,"Thank you for your input. You see, he did not release any information that is considered ""fraudulent"". He stated his bearish outlook on a stock just as a journalist  may state theirs in an article. He formed his opinion based on information he finds credible in long term stocks, just you do. If we look at it from a bearish stand point, Gamestop has been on a decline for years, losing revenue each quarter, and so far has failed to deliver any innovation (as of right now) to keep up with the changing market. Any big time investor would bet against gamestop. It is almost foolish not too. But the shorting had gotten out of hand, and thats what alerted some vets and whales here on wsb, and started the movement to counter the short plays to potential create a short squeeze. Wsb move to buy into gamestop was a tactial move, and a good one but still risky as all bets are. 

Do some GME investors believe in a eventual revival? Yes, but many are in it for the potential money grab, as are the shorters. As for Citron, lets not forget he shorted Game stop for an easy money grab just yesterday, WAY after its been shorting for a while now.",2021-01-20 11:37:04,gjxodq8,t3_l15943,t1_gjxlmz7,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l15943/report_citron_research_to_the_sec_for_market/gjxodq8/,2,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52,,,0,comment

HammyHamDog,t2_4hgap9ik,"Well, in a perfect world, game stop would transition to digital, maybe work out something with game makers / console makers that they could create a site that would allow players to sell back their used digital copy for game credit towards a new game (same as they do now with hard copies of games), maybe sell cloud storage, or whatever the ‚Äúchewy guy‚Äù has up his sleeve to turn the company around... As long as the company can make money, and/or show growth, then why does there have to be an end game? What‚Äôs the end game with any other company?

Cohen can and I‚Äôm betting will turn this ship around. It‚Äôs not going bankrupt anytime soon, and with a decent plan and execution this should have a 5-7 bil mkt cap minimum. 

Step back a bit and see the big picture. This might drop 15% tomorrow or pop 15% tomorrow but in the long term even without a squeeze this is an incredibly smart bet. Very limited downside and huge upside opp.

InvestingAmatuer,t2_7us0dwhj,"Alright my fellow autists based on my understanding of the video posted by u/hipetyhopetis and some other DD we are looking at a minimum price point of $150 just based on the ratio of free shares to shorted shares. It is definitely higher than that because the ratio only accounts for 30 percent of the free shares being locked down, it doesn't take us into account nor the rest of the traders who know to üíé‚úã the stock until it peaks. We have the power here, the price is what we want it to be as long as we hold it until it gets there. We also need to buy up as many shares as we can to support the war effort and to make sure that the shorters don't get them to cover their positions. They need to realize that this is weaponized autism and they should be afraid. The only way to drive that point home is to hit their wallets. I want their position so fucked they come here to post loss porn and if we all hold together we can make it happen.

Wasabii12315,t2_115tnv,"This is stupid and you probably know it, but in case you didnt, let me quickly disect your points for you and show why they are moot. 

Basically what you are arguing is that Ryan Cohen wont be able to compete with Sony and Microsoft in selling games, since you didnt do any research and thought the plan was for Gamestop to keep relying on games for the majority of their cash flow. This is wrong in many ways. The plan isnt to keep selling games, but somehow do it online, and thus stay in bussiness. The plan is to switch focus to becoming a cultural center for everything gaming. The one stop for gaming, a game stop if you will. Imagine stores filled with PC parts and accecories, gaming collectibles, esports events and an internet cafe section with cunning employees who can help you with anything computer or gaming related. All these items are high-margin items in a market that is growing by over 10% yoy with some projections showing future growth to be even higher. Heck even today 1/6th of Gamestops revenue, about 1 billion dollars, already comes from collectibles and that stuff is high margin af. Over 33% of revenue comes from online sales and their website is shit. Imagine if you had people who were actually cunning in e-commerce running the show with 55 million registered members in the US alone...

Thats how they improve cashflow, along with shutting down stores that arent profitable or barely profitable and which woudlnt make sense to renovate on the scale necessary.  The whole going bankrupt thing is a joke as well, they have been improving their margins and cut costs by over half in 2020 alone, if you think a shift to higher margin items already take place,  a halving in cost and all the other changes will have them loose as much money as they did during 2020 and will go bankrupt in 6-8 months then you are beyond saving

Lastly let me touch on your short-squeeze comments. This is the place where I can notice the most that you didnt do any research, since noone is saying that we are in the short squeeze right now, or that Melvin capital has been covering their shorts. Reverse there have been like 1000 posts by now about how the short interest has actually increased to record levels in the past week. This is a good thing, it means the squeeze would be based off of current levels, which are about 2x what they were before, and that there is more squeezing to be done since more shorts would need to cover their position. Just sustaining this price levels, without a jump in price once RC announces his plan for Gamestop going forward, or when he inevitably increases his share % to 19.9% or if Gamestop has a profitable quarter, even if none of that happens, shorts would have to sell their positions within 2 months or they would loose more in fees than the entire earnings potential of their positions and thats not even taking into account the literal billions of dollar they have paid in fees to maintain them so far. Even if you didnt think Gamestop had a long future ahed of it, the short squeeze would still be very likely. 

Let this be a lesson, dont go calling Ryan Cohen, Michael Burry and the tons of other GME investors who are way smarter than you retards. Best of luck trading and please short GME for us.",2021-01-17 18:49:42,gjmu72x,t3_kzbc05,t3_kzbc05,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kzbc05/gme_this_cycle_biggest_value_trap_how_retails/gjmu72x/,46,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52,,,1,comment

How is Amazon going to compete with an in person event. Idk how to capitalize on it, but you at least remember going and standing in line for like skyrim or halo amd shit. People were hype. It was fun. Then everyone raced home to play. But now people seem to just watch streams before even jumping in. 


Imagine release day where you had 10 screens with the top streams running. I think the angle is take 1 out of every 10,000 people from twitch chat and put them in the store buying candy and picking up a new controller. We'll have to see what the plans are, but if the company was worth $X doing jack shit for 10 years except overcharging for used games, id have to imagine its not hard to move that value up some with minor innovations, let alone a chewy-like transformation.",2021-01-17 15:52:08,gjlrjxm,t3_kz0x3v,t1_gjlpk93,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kz0x3v/gme_yolo_update_shares_only_jan_16/gjlrjxm/,3,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52,,,0,comment

 Looking at game stop as just a business plan theoretically and  neglecting the fundamentals  there are way to many avenues into getting better deals .. most ""neck beards"" will buy their card stock off [TCGplayer.com](https://TCGplayer.com) or ebay or a local game store .. 

most ""gamers"" will start to get their games off the internet because its easier than having to go to GameStop  - believe it or not steam / xbox market place ALL have deals on games that aren't fully priced 

After the console rotation only because- they were and are impossible to find will this really come into effect much harder

duplicatesnowflake,t2_lptfj,"See if you can find their older posts. Cliff's Notes:

GME has been shorted to death over the past few years with the conventional wisdom saying that it was essentially going bankrupt being a brick and mortar retailer who's main product has been migrating to online downloads.

However the DD essentially showed that the stock was way undervalued just based on cash on hand and expected revenues alone. There was no way in hell it would go bankrupt any time soon. Furthermore the average gamer does not have the internet speeds needed to go 100% digital only. Physical purchases will still be required for some time.

Michael Burry (Big Short fame) hopped in for a huge chunk with a contrarian play amidst the short frenzy. Ryan Cohen (founder of Chewy) then hopped in as an activist investor and has continued loading up to over 10% for months. The board played a game of chicken with him lining up a shelf offering, but proceeded to flinch after he upped his stake even further.

As all of this has been happening the stock was mooning from the $3-$5 range up to the mid teens and low 20s these past few months, with some nose bleed dips in between. Microsoft has been revealed to have a revenue sharing partnership with GME where GME gets a cut of future digital downloads made on XBoxes originally purchased at GME.

The console cycle hit, and it's clear that alone will be enough to let GME at worse tread water for another 6 months as they allegedly start transitioning to a much larger online presence. Game resale continues to be a decent revenue stream as well.

All the while, short interest has not really let up as of December 31st. 

Ryan Cohen was just recently offered a spot on the board this week and that may have been the final straw for some of these major short players. He turned Chewy into an online phenomenon this year and people are essentially shook that he will take over as an executive at Game Stop and get them headed in the same direction.

Bottom line, for at least a fraction of shorters the bankruptcy thesis is now blown up and they're looking for a way out without too much bleeding. Melvin Capital was allegedly averaging a borrow price of around $24 per share, but we just blew right past that yesterday.

There are more shorts borrowed then shares in existence right now, and a lot of big dogs are not willing to part ways with them for anything under triple digits a share. So if panic sets in among the shorts we could see a cascade of buying to close positions and the squeeze will officially be squozen.

This is the theory anyhow.",2021-01-14 09:49:29,gj7pb05,t3_kwscdd,t1_gj7lem1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwscdd/wsb_austists_after_yoloing_gme_and_making_their/gj7pb05/,16,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52,,,0,comment

quixoticM3,t2_fh1ux3s,"Yeah, didn‚Äôt think so. 

In my mind, I‚Äôm drawing parallels to the pet industry:
1. Target/Walmart/etc all sell your basic pet supplies. Nothing particular fancy
2. Petco/Petsmart are more sophisticated and cater to a larger swath of pet owners and pet needs as well as offer services for pets such as grooming.
3. Boutique pet shops often specialize in more high end supplies or niche pet markets
4. Online, you‚Äôll find what you want somewhere (from 1, 2, or 3), but also small garage operations, international, etc.

Looking at the landscape for gaming, it looks the same, but with a gap
1. The same... Walmart, target, Best Buy, etc
2. Nobody
3. Your local card or game shop, GameStop 
4. Find anything online

The primary difference is #2. You have a highly fragmented industry with very strong markets for certain areas: video console/pc games, trading card games, board games (roughly in that order) 

It seems like a no brainer to bring scalability and consolidation to the gaming industry and create a one-stop-shop or one-‚Äúgame‚Äùstop-shop.

GameStop can move into position and be in a class of their own. They better use all the 1st mover advantage and defend against the 2nd mover advantage as much as possible with the time they have.",2021-01-10 18:07:10,gis7fym,t3_kue1o0,t1_girxrcs,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kue1o0/why_gme_stock_is_going_to_the_and_beyond/gis7fym/,5,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52,,,0,comment

duplicatesnowflake,t2_lptfj,"Sounds like that was a logical thesis but the shorts got too far ahead of themselves. GME still has revenue coming in and a tremendous amount of cash on hand to the point that bankruptcy would still be years away at least.

So the book value of the company was way higher than the stock price. With two major console releases in Q4 you can bank on GME seeing solid revenues for the next 6-9 months as well.

Enter Ryan Cohen, Michael Burry and an army of retail investors putting pressure on the execs to make up for lost time in the online sales arena (better late than never). Microsoft soon inked a profit sharing deal on digital downloads bought on Game Stop sold devices.

Suddenly a ""dying"" brick and mortar company has a few lifelines to keep them afloat while they make a legitimate effort to evolve into an online company. Meanwhile many gamers still require physical disk purchases due to lagging internet speeds. 

Next generation console releases also ensure that that the resale market should continue booming into 2021. 

GME is now looking at multiple high revenue quarters on the horizon. And with the stock shorted to the tits you may find a lot of bears racing to get off the ride before they lose more money.

Rushmore586,t2_2ulwt9y,"The opportunity cost alone is expensive. Then you add in a borrow fee on top of that (albeit low) and that's a pretty expensive price to pay for a trade that's not guaranteed to go in your favor no matter how long you wait it out. And that's the point I think you're overlooking. It is not a given that Game Stop keeps marching towards bankruptcy. It has survived some extremely negative catalysts and remains debt free with several positive catalysts on the horizon. It is entirely possible that GME is able to turn things around and find its niche for the long term. And if/once that becomes more apparent the whole ""wait it out"" thesis goes out the window.

Dat_Speed,t2_nwrv2,"hell yea dude. Short float increased from 100% to 129% today and the multi million dollar ryan cohen buy in really encouraged me [https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/gme](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/gme) 

I'm thinking the short squeeze will take 4-12 months to really peak. Weekly YOLO call buyers will get slaughtered like pigs (small size is fine tho). I got long term shares + ITM april GME calls. 

From what I gather the secret gay bear hedge fund we are fighting against is sophisticated and is using AI to try to shake out buyers. I'm guessing they have \~$50-100 million short with \~$5-10 million to manipulate the stock price with. Be skeptical of any news, especially from less reputable news sources or twitter rumors. I imagine they have even more tricks up their sleeve to come and am honestly excited to see it and learn from it. I'm continuing to buy the ""wtf? why?"" flash crash dips and have been making steady gains.

They can get all all the new controllers and accessories from amazon without leveling off couch.

pezmel,t2_zf6ok,"You guys and your GME hype. No one loves this company except those tricked into buying in. Sure that console cycle ran the two previous generations. This year ain't those. PS3 and PS4 had more supply and better games. PS4 games still look great, but it's a moot point because you can't get your hands on a system. This is a dead duck. 

But, but they have Chewbaca as a major investor, going to be ecommerce now! Listen, if it was that easy, he would have created 10 ""new"" ecommerce giants. Same for Bezos. 

But the second greatest short is coming! Ya think? Maybe, seems like a dumb bet when you have tons of other stock making nice weekly gains. But go ahead and bank on this short happening. 

Lastly, Gamestop is semi hated across their base. Gamers have bitched for years about their low value trades but they were the only game(stop) in town. Literally the main reason anyone went to Gamestop, is going away rapidly. But yes, please tell your family and friends at xmas to go all in. Buy shares!

Finance_69,t2_8cjtxg96,"So I just went to a game stop to see how business was going, and potentially calm my nerves a bit going into this next week with the er coming up. Of course, this is totally anecdotal and only based off what I saw in one store location, but I'm not sure if what I saw was good or bad. 

I walked in, and there was a decent amount of customers in the store. Probably about 10 people. But nobody was buying anything. Someone asked an employee if they had ps5s in stock and they said they were sold out and only had xbox's. Women said ""oh I'll just buy it online then."" And left. You'd expect that gamestop would have some sort of pre order system in place so she could place an order and pick it up next week or something. Maybe they are just super backed up on orders. These employees should be trained to at the very least direct customers to the Gamestop website. 

After that, another customer tried to buy a game, and the employee told him that they were sold out. 

So I think the fact this stuff is selling quick is bullish, but the fact they are losing potential sales due to lack of inventory is not a good sign. I still think this earnings report is going to be a big beat, and I do think this company is undervalued, but there are a lot of flaws with this business model that need to be addressed. They could be killing it right now if they got their shit together.",2020-12-05 19:36:41,geq6r0a,t3_k6tl0d,t3_k6tl0d,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k6tl0d/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/geq6r0a/,17,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52,,,0,comment

Will GME become irrelevant / obsolete in the future? Probably as hard disks / ssd becomes cheaper and more games are sold digitally.

does GME have competitors? Yep, the biggest e-commerce. Amazon, Walmart

does GME have any advantage over other e-commerce? Nope, if anything, Amazon will ship faster and reliably, and better customer support.

I don't understand what this ""e-commerce"" plan that keeps coming up. Gamestop already has option to purchase items online just like Best buy does. Hell, even one of my local clothes shop has one through shopify.

dawson3678,t2_wzqu1,"Just from why your saying though I can tell you don‚Äôt understand the gaming market. There were already examples of companies beating Amazon, Blue Apron, Hello Fresh ETC. 

Every single large gaming company has tried to make their own game browser to sell game, and without fail everyone is failing. The only two to have marginal success is the epic games launcher and Battle.net, and even then both are minuscule to the empire that is now Steam/Gamepass. It‚Äôs pretty clear what the future of gaming is, and it‚Äôs game by service and online purchase. All of which are already monopolized on PC/Xbox with Steam and Gamepass, and monopolized on Sony with whatever games by service they are releasing.

ActualArrival0,t2_5jfx2336,"""Thought and research process""?

He's been buying absolutely nothing except Gamestop for over a year. 

Gamestop is one of the worst companies in the world....reminds me of Blockbuster only much worse.

Obviously mentally retarded, probably late teens early 20s, and visits games stop several times a week to buy video games, and just thinks it is a great company. Maybe even works at a Game Stop as a totally dweeb. 

Here's some quick DD: 

[http://news.gamestop.com/static-files/57ac340d-3332-4e3a-a9ec-817bcf8ef0b1](http://news.gamestop.com/static-files/57ac340d-3332-4e3a-a9ec-817bcf8ef0b1)

They have 5500 dead stores that nobody visits throughout the world. 

See page 16, their annual sales has declined drastically from 5 years ago. 

2015: Over $9 billion in sales

2019: $6.5 billion in sales

They lost about $470 million in 2019. 

\-7.3% net income. In 2019, every time they sold $1000 in video games they lost $73. Selling things at a loss all year. 

Their most recent quarterly report shows they lost $110 million in the last 3 months. 

For 2020 they are on pace to drop to around $4 billion in sales which would be going about 15 years backward in time (except back in the early 2000s they actually made a profit).",2020-10-09 11:38:48,g87geif,t3_j7ki10,t1_g86l25d,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j7ki10/gme_yolo_update_oct_8_2020/g87geif/,1,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52,,,0,comment

dawson3678,t2_wzqu1, Man people who haven't been following Microsoft seem to think that they want to buy Game Stop. There is literally a 0% chance they are buying Game Stop. Microsofts plan with Xbox for the past 2 years has been to go towards a game by service business plan. Buying retail stores that have been failing the past 3 years because of digital sales is literally the polar opposite of their entire business model. Please do not go into Game Stop thinking this may be an option.,2020-10-08 23:04:04,g85u4xj,t3_j7kf7w,t3_j7kf7w,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j7kf7w/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_october_09_2020/g85u4xj/,8,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52,,,1,comment

dawson3678,t2_wzqu1,"Just adding on to this so if you already read it sorry

So did a little DD into the GameStop and Microsoft deal. Microsoft recently closed down all of their retail stores and it seems are using Game Stop as a temporary place to sell the new Xbox for the next year or so. As well GameStop is moving to using Microsoft data storage and gets Microsoft tablets (which doesn‚Äôt matter at all for us)

As well there is absolutely no exclusivity so GameStop will still be selling the PS5 Etc, which was obvious but still good. 

My biggest worry right now is I think this is very temporary. Clearly we know that Microsoft is trying to go completely digital in the next couple of years. This point is only more highlighted with their buy out of Zenimax a month ago. It‚Äôs clear Microsoft wants to have Game pass be the way that gamers get games instead of buying games. I think this is great for GameStop for the short term, as they will hopefully be the most benefited of the next gen consoles.

Saying that though this solves absolutely nothing of the problems it was facing. People are going to keep buying games digitally, and Microsoft‚Äôs entire strategy is to go completely by service in only a couple years.",2020-10-08 21:02:16,g85few6,t3_j7kf7w,t3_j7kf7w,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j7kf7w/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_october_09_2020/g85few6/,1,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52,,,0,comment

alotovanal,t2_8fsqyej,"GME partnership with Microsoft is  a total pump and dump scheme.
