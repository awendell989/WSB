&gt;Smead, who is chief investment officer of Smead Capital Management, warns traders riding the momentum (as my colleague Myles Udland reports, the trading activity is being fueled by speculative commentary in Reddit chat rooms) **they are likely to wind up defeated once the fervent buying settles down and rationale heads prevail**.

&gt;“The SEC is going to step in and stop people from gathering in basically a chat room like the AOL chat rooms in 1999, and doing a bull raid on a stock. **The short sellers have gotten incredibly crushed in all of these even before they ganged up on the stocks. Now they are ganging up on them.** Who is left to buy when the buyer at the margin is something that’s just trying to torture a short seller? This is incredibly unhealthy. **There will be hell to pay for what you are seeing on your screen right now,”** Smead says.

&gt;But the traders have piled into the name this month amid a boardroom shakeup and the arrival of Chewy founder Ryan Cohen as a 13% shareholder in the company. The developments have been interpreted by traders as transformational for GameStop, and they have jumped into the heavily shorted stock hand over fist. Momentum has beget momentum in the market for GameStop shares. Where it stops is unclear.

&gt;Now the crowd of short sellers have set their sights on similar stories.
Express — a dying mall-based apparel retailer —saw its stock surge more than 100% totally out of the blue at one point today. Similar to GameStop, the gang of short sellers appears to be taking their cue from favorable news earlier this month. Express secured $140 million in additional funding to help it ride out the COVID-19 pandemic.

&gt;However, Express and GameStop remain markedly weak companies from a fundamental perspective. **Neither company warrants to be worth 50% or more versus last Friday’s close, especially as there has been no fresh news in weeks.**

&gt;**The same could be said for BlackBerry, the newest well-shorted stock to be tossed into the speculative buying mania.** Shares rose 31% in Monday’s session, on no new news. The gas for BlackBerry’s sizzling rise looks to be it selling 90 patents to Huawei, but that happened several weeks ago.


&gt;While BlackBerry arguably has the best business model among GameStop and Express amid a push into auto technology for infotainment systems, **it’s hard to justify the company being worth 30% more versus Friday’s close.
Warns Smead, “The abuse for this stuff is going to cause a whole generation of people to not want to participate in the stock, which is exactly what happens every 30 years. We have to go through this.”**

Citron Research isn't the only one with twitter fingers. As a collective, we own enough enough shares to ask for a board seat. If we all made a ton of noise asking for the resignation of George Sherman for poor leadership and performance I bet it would have an impact, and likely bolster Ryan's position.

Under George Sherman's leadership GME shares have gone from \~$16 -&gt; sub $3. It has only seen a resurgence due to excitement around Ryan Cohen's potential move into the role of CEO.

We have already seen multiple instances where this group has been able to make it to mainstream news. With enough people pushing the narrative LOUDLY and FREQUENTLY there will be coverage.

This coverage will serve many positive outcomes. First, it will give more attention to GME likely increasing the number of people who see it for the opportunity it is and thus purchasing shares. Secondly, it opens up conversations around George Sherman's performance relative to GME and around its potential future with Ryan Cohen. This clear, constant, and consistent comparison would force more content around this comparison. This should hopefully encourage the board to make a decision sooner, rather than later.

**TLDR:** There are other benefits I could mention but the point is clear.

I don’t know the exact timing but here are some observations that I observe. 

The SEC rule 201 was lifted today. Which means the shorts had an opportunity to drive the price down as much as they could. There wasn’t a significant drive down as of today by 2:52pm. This makes me believe one of two thing:

1) Yesterday’s reports that there are no more shares to short are true. Which makes be believe that the shorts also took a long position at some point to hedge against to much upward loss. Which, if you have that kind of money in play is both smart to do and feasible. So now, they are burning through those shares to make us run out of steam and give up. I think this because if you look at volume spikes today, the stock goes up at significant increased volume spike and then slowly goes down from there. It looks like they are trying to match the buys and sells so the stock price stagnant. I don’t know how much stocks they have long to be able to do this but around half of the days volume has to be a sell if the price is somewhat flat. That’s a significant amount of shares if that’s the case. So who actually knows how much inventory they have less. My assumption is not many. In this scenario, it’s just a matter of time until they run out of steam if stocks continue to be purchased or people hold the shares. 

2) They still have available shares to short and we just don’t know it. Even though we have the reports that there aren’t any, there’s a chance that they are wrong. Because today is flat, means they didn’t use all the short shares available. This makes me think that they are going to try to get the price to go down tomorrow as a coordinated attempt during or after the Shitron live Twitter event. What they will try and do is spook the retail investors who don’t have the guts for volatility to sell at the same time, then they use the rest of the available short shares, and maybe sell the rest of their long shares ALL at the SAME TIME. That will spook other people and then a mass sale happens driving the price of the stock down. To me this could be a very real threat. Not sure what to do in this scenario, but I’m sure somebody who is much, much more experienced than me knows how to navigate (please please please comment below). I would assume that the longs need to know not to sell no matter what happens and rally one last time and buy up the rest of the shares. Hopefully, management knows this threat and also has a plan of their own.

Further thought of the situation, I think the shorts were forced to come up with some kind of PR that’s going to scare people. If they didn’t do that and then colluded together without that event, it would be deliberate market manipulation. But if they can piggyback on retail selling out, they can get away with pulling an all out attack. 

Luckily, for retail, they did give us a heads up of an event which gives retail the time to come up with its own plan on how to defend. 

Retail can do what everybody has been saying, don’t sell. Also, as shareholders and now there is a lot of you, you can suggest that GameStop corporate come up with a strategy as well or ask them to release some more info on their plans for the future and such. GameStop already has a bunch of press right now and some sorta news can be really good to combat what could happen tomorrow. As a public company they have to have its investors in its best interest. Since a short seller is not technically an investor yet (they haven’t physically bought shares like all of us) we might be able to nudge corporate in the right direction. Maybe send an email or give GameStop corporate a call and ask nicely for some news tomorrow.

Remember ASK NICELY. Retail may be Autists but we are good people. We are currently saving a company from bankruptcy. If you own 1 share or 10million shares of GameStop stock. You’re considered an owner of game stop.

The air was hot and stinking and the soft earth had left the wartable slanted. To his irritation the small figures representing his section of soldiers kept rolling off the table.



Around him were gathered aged and weathered men adorned in armor much too small for their frames, fattened from years of taking from the poor and helpless. The tent flaps parted and a bewildered soldier covered in blood and sweat stumbled in panting heavily.



“Gabrilus my liege, long may you reign over Melvinia!” The envoy gave a trembling salute with a limp wrist.
“My name is Gayus Bare and I have hid amongst the separatists, posing as one of them. My liege, the threat they pose is much greater than first thought.”



Gabe pursed his lips and shifted in his seat. His arse was sore. The altarboys he had bought from the Kingdom of Schitron had been particularly unrelenting in their nightly duties lately.



“Gayus Bare. . . How is it that a ragtag group of peasants have resisted against the might of Melvinia for months? Please, educate me how a bunch of up jumped monkeys have managed to repel countless assaults?”



Gayus was a simple man. Pessimistic if you asked his wife, though he never held much interest for her. Deep in his soul he knew the outcome of the campaign. He took a deep breath before committing.



“At first, my liege. It was only the Gamestopians. They were barely more than a gang of ruffians chasing dreams of yesteryear. A man appeared. A merchant of feed for hounds. He had built himself a successful business that led more farmers buying from him than the state itself.”



Gabe shook his head. “You’re telling me this is all because of a dogfood merchant?”



“His charisma is undeniable, my liege. The Palantards have pledged themselves to their cause. The Mountain of Steel and King Vito Corleone.  The Republic of Blaqberrie. The lost tribe of Gourd. Even across the sea, the Uropoors have been seen sending supplies. He surrounds himself with smart strategists and powerful champions. They carry a flag bearing a diamond with a simple peanut upon it. His greatest champion rides into battle wearing armor emblazoned with a roaring kitten. Soldiers swear he has the cunning of a tiger and the ferocity of a lion. The Roaring Kitty alone has flocked thousands of commoners to take up arms against us.”



The tent seemed to shrink and crush upon the beady eyes of Gabrilus. The ominous looming of his funder's expectations prodded at an already anxious mind. The Boomers were not a group to be slighted. After a moment of consideration Gabe had come to terms with the situation.



“Send out the messengers. Ply our allies of Schitron to debase and denounce the validity of these separatists. We must weaken their resolve. They are peasants. They will disperse. They must.”



The tent fell silent. A pounding grew in Gabe’s slightly misshapen head. Terrified howls and clanging swords could be heard. From the forests to the south, thousands of voices began chanting in unison.

I'm not really a trader, own some GME, but I've seen an opportunity for GameStop to be the ""Amazon"" of gaming for a long time.

I do inbound marketing (SEO and PPC) for pretty large companies for the past \~15 years almost and GameStop is literally leaving money on the table.

I've been trying to contact them and help them implement some easy changes that will help them rank on page 1 of google for huge keywords, and those rankings will translate to more traffic which will turn into more sales and of course more sales = hopefully stock price increase.

**Quick Analysis:**

[Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) \- Domain Rank Score 96 (Domain rank is a quick, not always accurate, but in this case a decent way of gauging a domains ranking power on Google)

[Bestbuy.com](https://Bestbuy.com) \- DR88 - I'll explain why this matters in a second.

[Newegg.com](https://Newegg.com) \- DR84 - Same

[Gamestop.com](https://Gamestop.com) \- DR81- So just on domain rank, Gamestop can hang with the big boys, Gamestops ability to rank for highly competitive keywords is fuckin insane, the domain has been around for a long time it's SUPER strong.

**Note:** Domain Rank is just 1 signal of a websites ability to rank, but there's a reason [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) ranks highly for anything without even trying, they have a super strong domain

GameStop also has a super strong domain just not utilizing it properly... like at all, they're making fuckin rookie mistakes and hopefully Ryan Cohen plans to fix them, but he and nobody else on the marketing department replies to my emails so who knows.

They should AT LEAST be able to hang with the big boys on page 1 for pretty much any gaming term they want, position 1 on Google will be tougher, but with the right strategy implemented they should be able todo it.

Now, check this one, 1 example *(I literally sent this to their entire marketing department they opened the email like 132 times and nobody responds saying thank you or yeah we're working on it, so I assume they are not)*

**Go to:**  [https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/pc/accessories/monitors](https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/pc/accessories/monitors)

**First problem:**

Look at the title tag in your browser by, it is optimized for ""PC Monitors"", WHY?! WHY?! You do not sell ""PC Monitors"" game stop, you sell ""Gaming Monitors"" do not try to cater to the masses.

Cater to the gamer, which by the way the term ""gaming monitors"" gets 246,000 searches/month, so there's still a massive amount of searches/demand for that.

**Second problem:**

There is literally 0 written content on the page, it's a list of monitors... go back to Google and search ""gaming monitors"" look at position #1 and #2 (best buy and newegg), notice they have a bunch of written text at the bottom of the page? Google likes this.

**Third problem:**

Look at Newegg and BestBuy pages again, notice they both have an h1 tag at the top of the page that says ""Gaming Monitors"".

Go back to Gamestops comparable version... there's not even an h1 tag.

**Intermission / rant:**

**GameStop** is making rookie mistakes with a powerhouse of a domain. They have such a strong domain, that just doing these 3 things would skyrocket them to page 1 of Google.

Most companies come to an industry with a shitty domain they registered 2 weeks ago, it has 0 authority in Google's eyes, no strength, but they nail all of these things I just detailed all of these easy wins, while a huge company like GameStop just overlooks this stuff.

... and this ""PC Monitors"" is just 1 example, they are missing the mark for EVERY category page on their site.

/end rant.

**Fourth Problem:**

Notice at the top of the page there's a banner ad? This is Google AdSense.

Why the hell are GameStop letting other companies run ads on their site? This is the sign of a company who has thrown in the towel, they get like $0.10 per click on that banner maybe. They should be monetizing their own traffic by selling visitors products, not allowing other companies, even competitors, to come buy their traffic for pennies.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why do I care / why should you?**

Yes it would be nice to see our GME shares go up, but also I'm really passionate about what I do, and I feel like I'm watching someone dig for oil and I know that if they just moved over 3 feet to the left they'd strike, I feel bad for not trying to help them.

I'm not trying to sell them on my SEO services, that would be cool to land them, but literally if they just take everything I outlined here and applied it with their already existing inhouse staff, they would without a doubt jump a shit ton of spots in Google and at least be in the fight against domains like Amazon, Newegg, Bestbuy, etc.

Right now they dont even exist when someone does a search for ""gaming monitors"" and dozens of other searches.

If they got to page 1, they'd increase traffic, clicks, hopefully sales.

I'm not really sure how to get this message in front of them, tried emailing the marketing department, tried ""tweeting"" them, maybe I'm just not patient enough for they just don't give AF.

The company med men has been in a distressed situation, I have been buying their stock over the past few weeks after they posted better than expect earnings. They look like they are on the brink of profitability, and the Illinois stores are the best performing assets. They have yet to open either of their 2 retail license in Boston due to community meetings but the location will soon open near Fenway park. 

This firm is trading at less than $100 million and they are in New York, Florida, Massachusetts, Illinois, Nevada, And California.

This is by no means the best and safest play in the cannabis space and you need a real brokerage like E*TRADE or fidelity to buy foreign issues that are also trading at penny stock levels. 

I think the cannabis community or the WSB community could make a move on this play and win beyond expectations.

As of writing this, PZZA is currently trading at $94.10 and the ATH is $102.25. It is basically guaranteed that it will go back to the ATH. It has also sailed past the 20 and 10 day moving average, so there is no resistance until ATH. This is great for options.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition, I suspect that PZZA could be forming a cup and handle pattern. If this plays out, the price target would be (ATH + (ATH - Bottom of Cup)), which is about $131.38. However, we won't know if this is a cup and handle until it happens.

Even if the pattern fails, a delivery pizza restaurant is a pretty safe place for your money to be during the pandemic.

&amp;#x200B;

**Other Numbers**

[Target price](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/PZZA/research-ratings) of $104.50 with a high of $116.00. I think this is low going off the chart.

[31 million shares](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=pzza) float. I know that's a lot, but Schnatter already owns almost [1.3 million shares](https://ir.papajohns.com/stock-information/ownership-profile).

Guys, it's take out pizza in a pandemic it should really be self explanatory.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now we can talk about how Schnatter can become reinvolved with the company, which should help PZZA stock even more. As you will see, ever since he left the company has not been in as good of a position.

**Why Schnatter Left**

In 2017, he made a controversial comment about how the [NFL player protests were hurting Papa John's sales](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/12/22/572779230/papa-johns-ceo-steps-down-following-controversial-remarks-on-nfl) because they were the official pizza sponsor of the NFL. I don't want this to get political, but this is essential to talk about. Schnatter stepped down as CEO but remained on the board of directors. Fast forward into 2018, where Schnatter was reported to have [used a racial slur](https://www.forbes.com/sites/noahkirsch/2018/07/11/papa-johns-founder-john-schnatter-allegedly-used-n-word-on-conference-call/?sh=376e4e6e4cfc) in a meeting and it was recorded. Then, he stepped down from his position and no longer had a role in the company (besides for shareholder).

&amp;#x200B;

**Schnatter's Fight for Innocence**

Ever since both of these allegations have surfaced, Schnatter has maintained his innocence and that his words were taken out of context. In a [recent interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lYGrUA6YjA) Schnatter had with the H3 Podcast (I know many people don't care for them, myself included, but those opinions don't change what Schnatter says in the interview) where he explained why both allegations were false. Regarding the NFL drama, Schnatter claims that he was talking about how the NFL had a leadership problem because they were not addressing the issue. [His exact words were,](https://www.foxbusiness.com/retail/ex-fbi-director-clears-papa-johns-founder-of-racial-bias-slams-clearly-inaccurate-media) ""*The NFL is hurting, and more importantly by not resolving the current debacle to the player and owner’s satisfaction, NFL leadership has hurt Papa John’s shareholders.""* In regards to the allegations of him using a racial slur, former FBI director Louis Freeh, wrote a [report](https://papajohnschnatter.report/read-the-report) where he explains how that in the phone call where he used a slur, he many times stated how he does not support any form of racism, and when he said the word, he was referring to how Colonel Sanders used it and it bothered him. There are two parts to the recording that Schnatter has been fighting in court to get released. The first part includes him using the slur and the context, and the second part includes the other people on the call celebrating after Schnatter hung up talking about how ""they got him"" and they needed to get it to the press right away. This is all according to the H3 interview. It is common sense that Schnatter would not want a recording made public that would damage him, and the company seems intent on keeping it secret, showing that they are likely hiding something.

&amp;#x200B;

**Sales are Slumping**

[Sales are decreasing](https://www.statista.com/statistics/221441/papa-johns-total-revenue/#:~:text=Revenue%20of%20Papa%20John's%20worldwide%202007%2D2019&amp;text=American%20pizza%20restaurant%20franchise%20Papa,seeing%20a%20decline%20in%20revenue) every year since his role as been minimized. It's as simple as that. They are in no way a failing company, they are just making less money than they were.

*Processing img 934fvr5jq4a61...*

In addition to slumping sales, in the [H3 interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lYGrUA6YjA), Schnatter claims that Papa John's total number of customers is down significantly and that the quality has decreased. He says he buys about 600 pizzas every 90 days from stores around the country to check on the quality. In my personal experience, I can say the quality at my local Papa John's has decreased over the past couple years.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why Schnatter Can Fix This**

Schnatter is more devoted to Papa John's than most CEOs (after Karp and Elon), even though he technically doesn't work for them anymore. As I said before, he does frequent quality checks on the restaurants. The reason he does is is because he cares about the franchise owners and employees who have been negatively impacted by the new management and slumping sales. Who else still puts effort into a company after they've been fired from it? Also, this is just speculation, but since he is still closely associated with the company it is still his reputation.

&amp;#x200B;

**What we can do**

It's simple, buy shares! If we buy enough shares of PZZA, we (along with Schnatter) can become the majority shareholder of the company. There are [just over 31 million shares float](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=pzza) and Schnatter still owns almost [1.3 million shares](https://ir.papajohns.com/stock-information/ownership-profile), or 3.88% of the company. If he can convince a few of the other large investors that it is in their best interest to see him in charge again, we can easily call a shareholder meeting, vote out those who wrongly accused him, and put him, back in charge.

&amp;#x200B;

**Historical Implications**

Schnatter has long been touting ""The Day of Reckoning"" but has not given any hints as to if it has already happened, if it is multiple events, or what it will be specifically. If we can accomplish this, WSB would go down in history (it already has) again for giving a man his company back... and we will make money in the process. We can be the day of reckoning!

&amp;#x200B;

**Is This Legal?**

Yes, it is perfectly legal. This would technically be a hostile takeover, which is legal, but we can just call it something else. Besides, I'm pretty sure Ryan Cohen is trying to do the same thing with Game Stop.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR**

PZZA chart shows easy money, Schnatter is innocent of accusations, only he can bring Papa John's back to its former glory, and we can be the ones to do that. The Day of Reckoning is here!

Good morning retards.

5G is already starting to replace 4G and this will be accelerated in the next two years. 

5G will also provide the foundation for new technologies Autonomous vehicles, Telemedicine, ""Smart factories"" and IoT.

Until now, Huawei was leeding the race to deploy 5G worldwide, but they are slowly getting banned from many western countires. As the FCC declaired:  *Both \[Huawei and ZTE\] have close ties to the Chinese Communist Party and China’s military apparatus, and both companies are broadly subject to Chinese law obligating them to cooperate with the country’s intelligence services… We cannot and will not allow the Chinese Communist Party to exploit network vulnerabilities and compromise our critical communications infrastructure.”* 

Huawei is loosing its market share and other companies will profit from it in the next couple years. 

$NOK and $ERIC are both very well positioned to benefit from the 5G deveopments and Huawei's downfall, as both companies have already secured more than a hundred 5G contracts. 

I believe that in the next years, as 5G becomes widely available, both of these copanies will grow a lot.

$GME is currently trading at $20.15. There are 70M shares outstanding and a short interest of 68M. Momentum slowed down a lot after Tuesday, but the price is holding above $20. These short positions were opened before the RC news, when the price was between $13 - $16. This means that unless the price falls back down below those levels, they'll have to pay a fine, which Is something like 20% + the price of buyback to hold the positions. But seeing as prices have been holding above $20 and news has all been positive since RC increased his stake, I don't see a nearly 50% drop happening soon. That's not to say they'll all cover, there were huge put orders right when the price started dropping, which could mean that institutions are trying to recoup losses through options.

**&lt;h2&gt;BUT&lt;/h2&gt;**

Even if 10% of those shares outstanding decided to cover next week, that's an additional 7M shares in demand. Recent volumes have been around 10M per day (not counting big news days). With almost a twice as many shares in demand as usual, we should expect to see some kind of pop. Maybe not a 300% short squeeze like,  but I wouldn't be surprised if it hit $25 next week.

MAD MONEY**

**Cramer**: We are here in Denver to talk to CEO of Palantir, Alex Karp.  Since [demo day on January 26,](https://palantir.events/livedemoday) we’ve seen a very interesting strategy for Phase 2 and we will hear more insights on the plan.

**Cramer**: Alex, thanks for joining us. 

**Karp**: Thanks for having me. 

**Cramer**: I’m a full blown retar-... scuse me, redditor now, and the question everyone is dying to ask is “what’s with that hair?“

**Karp**: You look at what Einstein has done, he made huge breakthroughs that changed the world.  That’s what we’re poised to do here at Palantir. And my hair is a nod to that brilliance.  Crazy hair is brilliance in the making. 

**Cramer**: In the live WSB discussions about 500 people are yelling that hair is an autist move. Thoughts on their reaction?

**Karp**: I have Aspergers. Like I fucking care.  

**Cramer**: Your margins and revenue beat expectations in Q1. Your stock has since doubled. The short position has also gone up by 10x doubting your Phase 2 expansion. Walk us through your next plan.

**Karp**: We call it Project GOTS. We built teams and a strategy to focus on addressing more purpose built applications to aim at a few sectors. Healthcare, CPGs, HR and Energy. 

These are underserved markets in dire need to make sense of their data in a more efficient way. Our product lines Gainer, Opus, Target, and Synergize will address these areas.

**Cramer**: That’s fantastic. And sounds intere... wait a minute WSB live is going nuts again. They’re all spamming... umm, we heh, can’t say this on the air. Umm, can you inform the audience on the Phase 1 product lines?

**Karp**: Yes. Phase 1 was mainly to serve the broad areas: enterprise data, expanding data analytics and Saas management. Our product lines are called Foundry, Apollo, Gotham.

**Cramer**: Wow, was that on purpose?

**Karp**: Yes, we wanted to get into areas that were...

**Cramer**: No, I’m talking about the names.

**Karp**: What about the names? Our employees voted to name our product lines.

**Cramer**: So you’re saying, you have a company culture that promotes F.A.G. products. And your phase 2...

**Karp**: Yes, Tesla wanted to literally sell sex. We were inspired.

**Cramer**: So you want to sell a bunch of F.A.G.G.O.T.S.

**Karp**: As much as possible.

**Cramer**: Wow.

**Karp**: Look. We are focused on doing the impossible. And being the most important software of the 21st century. Our product lines are unified to address that.

**Cramer**: They certainly are. Nobody can deny that naming convention.

**Karp**: We knew there would be controversy. But just like anything bold and risky, it’s free advertising. You might think it’s a dumb move but you are already giving me free press. Pretty soon every man, woman and child know we are in the business of F.A.G.G.O.T.S.

**Cramer**: Huh. I hadn’t thought of it that way.

**Karp**: No shit. It’s kind of like my hair. Looks awful at first glance, but the more you think, you realize it’s brilliant.

**Cramer**: I wish I had hair. 

**Karp**: OK Boomer.

**Cramer**: What?

**Karp**: OK Cramer.

**Cramer**: Haupt91 in the chat has said, “is Gainer a diss on Gay Bear? They sound similar.”

**Karp**: This guy fucks... Gay bears to be specific. Yes, we wanted our own “short shorts” like Elon. Why not have a slight to our doubters right in the name.

**Cramer**: Amazing and unique strategy. I know you are a busy man, so, Alex, thanks so much your your time. This is very informative.

Hey  guys, any of you that listend to the earnings/guidance from Game Stop know  how retarded management is.... We are all banking on an evolution or  chewie-fication of Game Stop rather than boomers doubling down on a dying  business and praying a new console cycle will save them. In light of the  new revelation that they are ""Creating"" 100m shares out of thin are to  either fight off cohens hostile take over, or to fuck us when the  squeeze takes off so they can profit off of us i was trying to figure  out how we as share holders can fuck over sherman and the fucks with him  and i found this gem...

""The  board of directors has the power to call general meetings and the   majority of general meetings will be called by the directors (S302 of   the Companies Act 2006).

The  members also have the ability to demand a general meeting.  Section 303  of the Companies Act 2006 requires the directors to call a  general  meeting once the company has received requests from members   representing 5% of the paid up share capital those entitled to vote at   general meetings of the company.

Under  S304, the directors must call a general meeting within 21 days  of  receiving such a valid request and provide for the general meeting to   be held on a date not more than 28 days after the date of the notice of   the meeting.

If the directors do  not call a meeting as required to do so, under  S304, the members who  requested the meeting, or any of them representing  more than one half  of the total voting rights of all of them, may  themselves call a  general meeting.

The Companies Act  2006 also gives the court the ability to order a  meeting and where a  resigning auditor has given a statement of the  circumstances connected  with his resignation, that auditor is also  entitled to call on the  directors of the company to convene a general  meeting for the purposes  of receiving and considering an explanation of  those circumstances. ""

For  those of you too retarded to see where this is going - all of us  holding shares should write a letter and demand a share holder  meeting.... WSB holds around 5% and im sure Cohen and Burry would help  out and boom... we get to force Game Stop/Sherman to address Cohens letter and  we get to ask the questions.. be the big man with the microphone... we  get to swing our dicks while looking at swim suit magazines.. we... oh  right i forgot to take my adult hyperactivity dis... oh look a butter fly... any how...

FREE TOYS AT THE BOTTOM.

&amp;#x200B;

Welp my friends. Like 2 days ago I said if Palantir made it to $30 by the end of the year, I’d give out a PS5 to someone in this subreddit.

While a 50% gain over 6 weeks sounded aggressive, turns out things are moving a tad faster around here.

Looks like we are over $30 in Europe. Fuck it. Let’s do this draw now. It’s American Thanksgiving after all.

\--

But before I live up to my promise and get into the details of how you enter this draw, I think I would be remiss if I didn’t use this opportunity to get my thoughts in about Palantir.

**First and foremost, will everyone who is calling PLTR a quote “meme stock” shut the hell up?**

Just because a bunch of gorilla IQ memers happen to be buying something, does not mean that the thing they are buying is stupid. All those dingleberries also own Androids and iPhones, does that doesn’t mean Google and Apple are “meme companies”? No.

Unlike actual meme stocks such as: unprofitable weed companies, camera companies gone pharma, car rental companies gone bankrupt, and little airlines living off corporate welfare - Palantir is actually a ROCK SOLID COMPANY with an extremely promising future.

This rally was predictable and **it will keep on going in the long run.**

Myself and many others in WSB, r/investing and r/stocks got in on day one - not out of chance - but because we did our due diligence and we could see the writing on the wall: Palantir has the potential to possibly become one of the most important tech companies in the world, and it is being led by people with a track record to back it up.

This stock isn’t mooning because we have posted 10,000 memes and shit posts. I'm sorry kiddos and Cramer, but our TikTok videos with a few thousand views aren't powerful enough to create $25B of stock market value.

There is something much larger at play here, and we in WSB are lucky enough to be along for the ride.

PLTR is heading to Mars because the financial institutions didn’t have the opportunity to get in before the IPO and now they are racing to catch up. Moreover, now that **Palantir’s first quarterly report has proven they are the real deal,** and everyone has started googling this pandora’s box of a company - the market is going “holy shit”.

The only question mark that was in Palantir’s path was the impact Joe Biden’s administration might have on the company's relationship with the US government.

With a former Palantir consultant Avril Haines at the helm of the entire US intelligence community as of this week, the risk of the new administration working against Palantir has been all but removed.

That’s why we are up bigly this week.

But more importantly, **you need to consider the global technological context of this company, to truly understand its future potential.**

1. In the 90’s PC’s took over. 
2. In the 2000’s it was all about the .coms.
3. The 2010’s was the era of wireless and mobile platforms.
4. 2020 WILL be the decade of smart automation through a global wifi network.

And because of that, there is now an information and technology cold war brewing. China and USA are racing to get control of the global internet infrastructure, and they are doing everything they can to invent true AI. 

Once the entire world and everything in your home goes “smart” and becomes connected to Starlink’s grid, someone or some*thing* is going to need to sift through the quintillions of zeroes and ones, to make sense of it all in real time. Guess who is **the only company in the world that has the know-how and business/political connections to fill that void?**

At the risk of getting too deep in the weeds here, I need to mention one last detail: You all need to read up on Project Maven.

For those of you who don't know, Project Maven is an AI drone project that Google was originally supposed to fulfill for the US Airforce. Google walked from the contract citing ""ethical"" concerns, and then Palantir picked up the pieces. Imagine how pissed the US Airforce was when Google called them unethical and embarrassed them?

This has a **very** important underlying implication. If you accept the premise that the American government is going ham in this technological revolution, there still remains the question as to who will be the primary benefactor. 

Common sense would suggest that companies like Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft will be working with the US government to create AI. However, Project Maven changed all that. 

Google's refusal to fulfill their top secret contract taught the government that they cannot trust the trillion dollar megacaps to be unequivocally and unapologetically pro-USA. Those companies are so big, that they don't need to choose a side in geopolitics, and they will almost certainly continue to offer their products to everyone around the world. 

When it comes to matters of national cybersecurity, the odds are that **the US government is going to put all it's eggs in a company that is unquestionably loyal and patriotic.** When the pentagon is creating a trillion dollar AI behemoth, they know they need to work with someone they can trust when push comes to shove. Palantir is the only AI company that is bold enough to do so, and **their founders have created a special the corporate share structure to ensure they will never lose control**.

So again, this is not a fucking ""meme stock"".

PLTR is mooning like your pubescent boner on viagra because everyone is starting to realize that this **magnificent titan the CIA created** (*see In-Q-Tel*) has gone public and will probably be at the forefront of the next global technological revolution.

So: 

* Stop worrying about a dip next week. (*Yes it might happen. So what?*)
* Stop worrying about a price crash post lock up. (*This will happen. But from what price to what price? Who cares?*)
* Stop trying to time the market to squeeze out an extra $1000. (*We aren’t smart enough or fast enough to win that game.*)
* Stop viewing Palantir like it’s a penny stock. It’s not.

**Start** looking at the year 2030 and imagine what you will do with your money then, if you grow the man balls (or lady balls) required to hold that long.

How you handle your positions over the next 6-12 months may be the most important decision of your life: do... not... sell…

There are only a handful of times in your life when a person should truly go all in. 1) When you meet the person you know you want to marry. When you decide to change your career. And when a company like Palantir goes public.

In 10 years, you can thank me. Today, I would like to thank you for your time and consideration.

God speed.

How about instead of pulling Scrabble tiles from your asses, you develop an educated opinion by performing top-down analyses. Perform your own research on the broader economy and identify how it may impact certain sectors, then industries, then companies. IDENTIFY viable investment opportunities, don’t take stabs in the dark and hope to get paid– Otherwise, you may very well end up getting paid... to take stabs in the dark (gay-prostitute joke).
